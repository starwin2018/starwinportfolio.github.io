				<li>
					<h4>
						<strong>Project 1 : </strong> Product Owner</h4>
					<span class="lieu">New Jersey</span>
					<span class="dates">2015 - Till now</span>
					<p>I have been working as a Product Consultant in a challenging customer environment under tight schedule. I have been engaging myself with requirement gathering, system study, framework analysis, development, testing and deployment activities. The objective of the project was to develop a rating engine for HNW USA and Canada Personal line products. And giving support as per ongoing business changes every month. I have developed entire Rating Engine (OpenL) for all 13 Canadian provinces. And I have developed numerous enhancements and have given support for 50 states of HNW USA products in CIP application. This involved entire personal lines of business which includes Auto, Home, Excess Liability, Earthquake and Collections. I have been responsible for development, unit testing, functional testing, deployment and production support activities of all applications in accordance with the projects adopted standards, for integration into different systems. I have extensive knowledge in designing Rating Engine and understanding the behavior of the application during its execution with respective to technical as well as business. With extensive knowledge in Exigen, OpenL, Webstudio, SOAP, XML Java, J2EE, SQL and Maven, I have managed to deliver solutions for complex business problems. Over the years, I can confidently say that I have provided solutions for various business problems of multiple insurance clients in north America.

						<strong>Project 2 : </strong>Team Laed</h4>
					<span class="lieu">Chennai</span>
					<span class="dates">2011 - 2015</span>
					<p>I played a key role in this project as a Senior Developer/ Team Leader. The objective of the project was to give prediction reports which helped the customers future investment directions. We developed an engine which collects historical data from different systems, process and predicts the future data through extrapolation techniques. This being a hit in the North American markets, we rolled out the same Predictive analytical model for Japan and EMEA market as well. This implementation of the predictive model in different geographies helped me to understand and appreciate the differences in insurance domain across geographies. I used Java Spring framework along with POI framework to develop the predictive engine. I have written all business logics in stored procedures and functions by using SQL. I had wide experience to work on SQL technology during this tenure. I also had experience to work on SSIS and Tivoli scheduler during this assignment.</p>

					<h4>
						<strong>Project 3 : </strong>Developer</h4>
					<span class="lieu">Chennai</span>
					<span class="dates">2009 - 2011</span>
					<p>As the business demands new technical adaptations every month for their changing business, I have delivered solutions that have made the business implementations in easier way through my expertise in J2EE and DB2 related technologies. The objective of the project was to give support for an Insurance Agency system. This was a production support team. I was part of 60-member team who gave support along with minor enhancements. I participated in requirement gathering and analysis of the specifications which helped me to understand in project planning. I was also responsible for end-to-end delivery/maintenance, Co-ordination the QC certification. I also took up complete responsibility of the development and testing of the Accounting module, which interacted with batch reports and many sub systems. I had opportunity to work with Agency Framework, Web Services and SQL during this tenure.</p>

					<h4>
						<strong>Project 4 : </strong>Research Assistant/Co-Author</h4>
					<span class="lieu">Chennai</span>
					<span class="dates">2008 - 2009</span>
					<p>Under the leadership of an excellent professor, I researched the topic “Pressure Drop Characteristics of Water Flow
						through Static Annular and Triangular Cavity Labyrinth Seals” for more than a year. The objective of the research was
						to provide a better design which would give highest possible pressure drop in seals. This challenged me to find the
						right sized seal design from thousands of possibilities. To predict the closely accurate design, I created a “Predictive
						Analytical” model by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). To confirm my prediction results, I created a prototype
						and experimented in IGCAR sponsored lab. To back my result, I did the same experiment through “Image Processing” technique
						by using MATLAB. This paper was published in an international journal “Engineering Applications of Computational Fluid
						Mechanics”. This research experience helped me to understand the optimization techniques along with the descriptive
						and predictive analytical models in the field of engineering.</p>

					<h4>
						<strong>Project 1 : </strong> Data Science Student</h4>
					<span class="lieu">New Jersey</span>
					<span class="dates">2018 - Till now</span>
					<p>As part of my MS in Data science course I have done lot of machine learning and EDA projects. I have done an extensive data analysis over a bank data set and applied multiple classification models over the data set. Through that I predicted whether customer will become a defaulter or not. And summarized that which model will be a better fit for this dataset based on the impact of multiple accuracy measures. Similarly, I have done an extensive data analysis over Insurance customers dataset to find an tailor made algorithm based on customer life style, health and habits. I did regression modeling to predict the relationship between customer life style and claims which helps me to create a tier logic for those customers to derive a tailor-made insurance premium calculation logic. I have used R studio, SQL, Rapid miner, Python and Tableau for this project.
